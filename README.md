Project 4 or the Web developer course project ready for review and validation.
The project is concerning SEO and "Optimizing an Existing website".
Concerning the website of an Atlanta based Web designer i have been contacted in order to better the SEO for the page so that it will show up as one of the first results on Google when searching for a Web designer in Atlanta.

My role is to optimize accessibility and SEO scores while using the google Lighthouse tool.
I have improved the Structure of the page aswell as the Keyword content and Speed Optimization, which clearly shows in the before and after of the website analysis.

Find below the before and after scores directly from Lighthouse.
